This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

Follow along with a video of how this app was created on [Free Code Camp's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiCH27qsNL8) (referenced [on their blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-and-deploy-a-hotel-management-site/)). NOTE: without following along the video you will not have the database project setup on Sanity and you will not have any content for the demo site itself which means the above mentioned 'run the development server' will fail out of the box.
